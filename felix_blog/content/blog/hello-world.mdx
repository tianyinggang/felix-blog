# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post on my newly built portfolio website. I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development, design, and various programming topics.

## Why I Built This Site

Building this portfolio site has been a great learning experience. I wanted to create a platform where I could showcase my projects and share my knowledge through blog posts.

Here are some of the technologies I used:

- **Next.js 14** - For a fast, SEO-friendly React framework with the new App Router
- **ContentLayer** - For managing MDX content
- **TailwindCSS** - For styling
- **TypeScript** - For type safety
- **Framer Motion** - For smooth animations

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component using TypeScript:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

interface CounterProps {
  initialCount: number;
}

export function Counter({ initialCount = 0 }: CounterProps) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}
