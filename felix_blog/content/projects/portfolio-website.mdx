## Challenges & Solutions

Building this site presented several interesting challenges:

### Content Management

I wanted a solution that would allow me to write content in Markdown but also include React components when needed. ContentLayer provided the perfect solution, making it easy to manage MDX files and access them through TypeScript.

### Performance Optimization

Next.js's built-in image optimization and static site generation capabilities made it easy to create a fast, performant website. I also used the App Router for improved routing capabilities.

### Responsive Design

Using TailwindCSS made it simple to create a fully responsive design that looks great on devices of all sizes.

## Outcome

The result is a fast, modern website that showcases my work and provides a platform for my blog. The site is easy to maintain and update with new content.
